        <h1>Limiting Log output</h1>
        <p>In addition to output-formatting options, git log takes a number of useful limiting options; that is,
            options that let you show only a subset of commits. You’ve seen one such option already — the -2
            option, which displays only the last two commits. In fact, you can do -<n>, where n is any integer to
            show the last n commits. In reality, you’re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all
            output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.
            However, the time-limiting options such as --since and --until are very useful. For example, this
            command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:
            44
            $ git log --since=2.weeks
            This command works with lots of formats — you can specify a specific date like "2008-01-15", or a
            relative date such as "2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago".
            You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria. The --author option allows
            you to filter on a specific author, and the --grep option lets you search for keywords in the commit
            messages.
            
            You can specify more than one instance of both the --author and --grep search
            criteria, which will limit the commit output to commits that match any of the
            --author patterns and any of the --grep patterns; however, adding the --all-match
            option further limits the output to just those commits that match all --grep
            patterns.
            Another really helpful filter is the -S option (colloquially referred to as Git’s “pickaxe” option),
            which takes a string and shows only those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that
            string. For instance, if you wanted to find the last commit that added or removed a reference to a
            specific function, you could call:
            $ git log -S function_name
            The last really useful option to pass to git log as a filter is a path. If you specify a directory or file
            name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files. This is always
            the last option and is generally preceded by double dashes (--) to separate the paths from the
            options:
            $ git log -- path/to/file</p>
