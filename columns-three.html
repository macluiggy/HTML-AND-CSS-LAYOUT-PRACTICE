    <h3>limiting log output</h3>
    <div id="col1">
        <h3>title1</h3>
        <p>In addition to output-formatting options, git log takes a number of useful limiting options; that is,
            options that let you show only a subset of commits. You’ve seen one such option already — the -2
            option, which displays only the last two commits. In fact, you can do -<n>, where n is any integer to
            show the last n commits. In reality, you’re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all
            output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.
            However, the time-limiting options such as --since and --until are very useful. For example, this
            command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:</p>
